### Retro Vim

A series on rewriting and older version of Vim. One problem with Vim is that,
even though it's great, it has built a lot of technical debt in the code base.
This series addresses that by rewriting/refactoring it from an earlier point
in its history when it was not so large of a project (making it easier to redo).

 - [x] [First Build](retro-vim/part-1)
 - [x] [First Bug/Fix](retro-vim/part-2)
 - [ ] Refactor: main.c
